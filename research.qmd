## Current Topics

My current research primarily revolves around optimization and evaluation in transportation and logistics systems. One of my key projects involves optimizing SKU-Warehouse allocations to minimize split parcels in e-commerce environments. This research aims to enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs in warehouse management, which is crucial for improving the overall performance of e-commerce logistics.

Additionally, I am engaged in evaluating on-demand line-based bus services. This study focuses on assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of flexible bus services that adapt to passenger demand in real-time, offering more sustainable and user-centric public transportation solutions.

Furthermore, I am working on a computationally efficient optimization approach for real-time passenger flow balancing in urban rail transit systems. This research addresses the critical safety challenges posed by overcrowding during peak demand periods, such as large-scale events. By developing a linear formulation that models the transit network as a flow system with time-dependent capacities, we aim to provide a practical framework for transportation planners to prevent dangerous overcrowding while maximizing system utilization.

These projects collectively aim to contribute to the advancement of transportation and logistics systems, making them more efficient, safe, and adaptable to modern demands.
