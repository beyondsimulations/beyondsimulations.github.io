    "text": "My current research primarily revolves around optimization and evaluation in transportation and logistics systems. One of my key projects involves optimizing SKU-Warehouse allocations to minimize split parcels in e-commerce environments. This research aims to enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs in warehouse management, which is crucial for improving the overall performance of e-commerce logistics.\nAdditionally, I am engaged in evaluating on-demand line-based bus services. This study focuses on assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of flexible bus services that adapt to passenger demand in real-time, offering more sustainable and user-centric public transportation solutions.\nFurthermore, I am working on a computationally efficient optimization approach for real-time passenger flow balancing in urban rail transit systems. This research addresses the critical safety challenges posed by overcrowding during peak demand periods, such as large-scale events. By developing a linear formulation that models the transit network as a flow system with time-dependent capacities, we aim to provide a practical framework for transportation planners to prevent dangerous overcrowding while maximizing system utilization.\nThese projects collectively aim to contribute to the advancement of transportation and logistics systems, making them more efficient, safe, and adaptable to modern demands."

    "text": "Hi there! I’m Tobias, a researcher based at the University of Hamburg. My passion lies in using quantitative tools like applied optimization and simulation to tackle real-world problems – think improving public transport during major events or helping police plan their service areas more effectively.\nAlongside my academic work, I’m the founder of BeyondSimulations and co-founder of decorum SOLAR, putting these analytical skills into practice in different ventures. I use programming tools like Julia and Python in my work and also enjoy teaching, sharing my course materials openly online.\nWhether through research, my entrepreneurial work or teaching, my aim is to bridge the gap between academic methods and practical application, helping create better systems for everyone."
