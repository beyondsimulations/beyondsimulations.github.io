My passion lies in using quantitative tools like applied optimization and simulation to tackle real-world problems – think improving public transport during major events or helping police plan their service areas more effectively.\nAlongside my academic work, I’m the founder of BeyondSimulations and co-founder of decorum SOLAR, putting these analytical skills into practice in different ventures. I use programming tools like Julia and Python in my work and also enjoy teaching, sharing my course materials openly online.\nWhether through research, my entrepreneurial work or teaching, my aim is to bridge the gap between academic methods and practical application, helping create better systems for everyone."
